# COVID-19 model

### Purpose

This model attempts to simulate the spreading of COVID-19, which is one of the worst pandemic occurs in the modern world . Many countries has implements preventative policies to reduce the spreading. One of the most common policy is travel restriction, not only between countries , but also things such as mandatory self-isolation  and lockdown . This model addresses all of those things to see whether they are effective in the fight against the disease. Aside from that, the model also simulates how these restrictions could affect the economy conditions of the general population and how to keep it stable. 

The primary result of this model is how the implemented policies, both on travel restrictions and economical condition affects the value of R0. 

### To run this program, NetLogo is required


### How to start the program
- git clone or download the repository, open the model with NetLogo
- configures the variables. The available configurations are as following

Note that the values related to travel-chance should be between 0-100.

- Then, click setup, on start the layout should be similar to this following image.

- after that, to start the simulation click go then the agents and the graphs should start updating.
